# CODESOFT: Artificial Intelligence Internship Tasks

Welcome to my Artificial Intelligence Internship Portfolio! In this repository, you will find a collection of projects that I have completed during my internship at Codsoft. Each project showcases my skills in data analysis, Artificial Intelligence, and problem-solving. Below is a summary of the projects:

# Tasks (Any Three)

## Task_1. CHATBOT WITH RULE-BASED RESPONSES

Description: Build a simple chatbot that responds to user inputs based on predefined rules. Use if-else statements or pattern matching techniques to identify user queries and provide appropriate responses. This will give you a basic understanding of natural language processing and conversation flow.

## Task_2. TIC-TAC-TOE AI

Description: Implement an AI agent that plays the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe against a human player. You can use algorithms like Minimax with or without Alpha-Beta Pruning to make the AI player unbeatable.
This project will help you understand game theory and basic search algorithms.

## Task_3. IMAGE CAPTIONING

Description: Combine computer vision and natural language processing to build an image captioning AI. Use pre-trained image recognition models like VGG or ResNet to extract features from images, and then use a
recurrent neural network (RNN) or transformer-based model to generate captions for those images.

## Task_4. RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM

Description: Create a simple recommendation system that suggests items to users based on their preferences. You can use techniques like collaborative filtering or content-based filtering to recommend
movies, books, or products to users.

## Task_5. FACE DETECTION AND RECOGNITION

Description: Develop an AI application that can detect and recognize faces in images or videos. Use pre-trained face detection models like Haar cascades or deep learning-based face detectors, and optionally
add face recognition capabilities using techniques like Siamese networks or ArcFace.
